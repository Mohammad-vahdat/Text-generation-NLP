# Text-generation-NLP

I created networks that can generate text, here it is done character by character. The text generator is implemented using both TensorFlow and PyTorch. 


I chose all of shakespeare's works, mainly for two reasons:

1. It's a large corpus of text, its usually recommended you have at least a source of 1 million characters total to get realistic text generation.
2. It has a very distinctive style. Since the text data uses old style english and is formatted in the style of a stage play, it will be very obvious to us if the model is able to reproduce similar results.
